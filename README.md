Install node  
npm install  
node socketApp.js  
go to localhost:3000/  
Enter your classes and your friend's  
Hit submit and get a list of schedules for the both of you where you have as many classes together as possible

Bugs :(  
Some queries will only return one class for multiple students when many where selected (CMSC411, and HACS100 for both, order matters)  
For some reason cannot request again without restarting server (???)
